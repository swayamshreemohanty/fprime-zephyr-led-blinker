# Stm32LedBlinker ZephyrRTOS Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the Stm32LedBlinker Application

In order to build the Stm32LedBlinker ZephyrRTOS application, or any other F´ application, we first need to generate a build directory.
You must append the `-DBOARD=board_name` flag when you generate, where `board_name` must be replaced by supported boards by Zephyr.

You can view the list of supported boards [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html).

A build directory is generated with the following command:

```
fprime-util generate -DBOARD=board_name
```

The next step is to build the Stm32LedBlinker application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
fprime-gds -n --dictionary ./build-artifacts/zephyr/Stm32LedBlinker/dict/Stm32LedBlinkerAppDictionary.xml --comm-adapter uart --uart-device /dev/ttyACM0 --uart-baud 115200
```

> Change `/dev/ttyACM0` to your respective serial device.
